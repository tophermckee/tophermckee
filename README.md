# You can't fix what you can't measure.
I am a Product Manager at [Kindertales](https://www.kindertales.com/). I use mostly Python to automate my workflows. My previous work as a data manager involved sending weekly data reports to fellow colleagues to make sure we're constantly keeping data at the forefront when running the school.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on automating my random stuff with the Todoist API and an SMS-based goal/assist tracking system for my Sunday league soccer team
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning more about NoSQL databases
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
    - Automating communication at schools
    - Connecting the many different data tools schools use
