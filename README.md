# You can't fix what you can't measure.
I am a Product Manager at [Kindertales](https://www.kindertales.com/). I use mostly Python to automate my workflows. My previous work as a data manager involved sending weekly data reports to fellow colleagues to make sure we're constantly keeping data at the forefront when running the school.

- ğŸ”­ I'm currently working on any automating my current workflows with the Todoist API.
- ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning more about NoSQL databases (and ğŸ¦€RustğŸ¦€ cause Zucky says so ğŸ‘½)
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about:
    - Creating automated email reports for students and families
    - Updating data dashboards and freeing yourself of **slow** Google Sheets / Excel formulas
