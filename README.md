# You can't fix what you can't measure.
I am a Professional Services Specialist at [SchoolMint](https://schoolmint.com/). I use mostly Python to automate my workflows. My previous work as a data manager involved sending weekly data reports to fellow colleagues to make sure we're constantly keeping data at the forefront when running the school.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on any automating my current workflows with the Todoist API.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning more about NoSQL databases (and ðŸ¦€RustðŸ¦€ cause Zucky says so ðŸ‘½)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
    - Creating automated email reports for students and families
    - Updating data dashboards and freeing yourself of **slow** Google Sheets / Excel formulas
