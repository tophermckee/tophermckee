# Welcome to my profile!
I am a data manager at a high school in New Orleans, LA. I use mostly Python to automate my workflows. Most of my involves sending weekly data reports to fellow colleagues to make sure we're constantly keeping data at the forefront when running the school.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on building a Discord bot to keep my family updated on our weekly spending budget.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning C++ because I love learning new languages!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
    - Creating automated email reports for students and families
    - Updating data dashboards and freeing yourself of **slow** Google Sheets / Excel formulas
